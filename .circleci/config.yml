      # CircleCI's current generation of Node images, cimg/node, allow you to leave the
      # patch version unpinned, but require you to specify the minor version. The one
      # exception is cimg/node:current, which will always give us the latest release in
      # the latest major version-- and the latest major version is where it's most likely
      # that there would be a new minor version, anyway.
      # The cimg/ images do not include major versions that were never LTS and are no
      # longer supported, like 9 and 11, or extremely old ones like 6 and 7. For these,
      # we fall back to the old circleci/ images, pinned only to the major version.
